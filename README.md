# Bachelorarbeit „Effiziente Verteilung von Vorhersageergebnissen in einem hierarchischen Prognosemodell“

This repository contains research conducted for my bachelor thesis on hierarchical time series forecasting models. The project focuses on developing efficient methods for distributing forecast results across different hierarchical levels while maintaining forecast accuracy and reducing computational costs.

## Project Overview

The thesis investigates hierarchical forecasting models that are crucial for information processing in business environments. These models play a vital role in planning and decision-making across various organizational levels and need to be precise, consistent, and efficiently designed to minimize creation costs.

### Key Features

- Implementation of various forecast reconciliation methods in R
- Efficient top-down distribution algorithms
- Cost optimization while maintaining forecast quality
- Hierarchical data structure handling using S-matrices

## Methods Implemented

### 1. Top-Down Method
- Custom distribution algorithm written in R
- Calculation of historical proportions
- Disaggregation of forecast values
- Determination of average values at the lowest level
- Reconciliation of forecasts using bottom-up method
- Uses aggregation matrix as a blueprint for efficient distribution

### 2. Combined Conditional Coherent (CCC) Method
- Focus on two-level hierarchy coordination
- Utilizes specific elementary 2-level hierarchies within the overall structure
- Efficient distribution to the lowest level without extensive calculations
- Improved results through better approximation of base forecast values

## Results

- Achieved 41% cost reduction while maintaining forecast accuracy
- Top-Down method shows comparable forecast accuracy to reference method
- CCC approach results vary based on base forecast value accuracy
- Successfully demonstrated efficient forecast distribution while maintaining quality
